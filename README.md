## This is my Escape From Tarkov Trade Bot written in python 3.
It is released for educational and historical reasons only. It is not recommended for anyone to use it. I personally got banned because of that, and I fully agree with this ban.

However, this code is provided as it is without further support.

It has many unsolved issues such as race conditions, zombie threads, semi-automatic and semi-manual usage.
It also supports only rubles transactions. 

The reason I got banned is that the Bot sends too much requests to EFT's backend to buy needed slots on Flea Market.
The reason for such spam was that market's timeouts are not predicable one has to send lots of requests per second to be the first to buy it.


Anyway I got a lot of fun when reverse engineered the game's traffic to learn how to use the API.
